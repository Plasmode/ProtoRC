# ProtoRC
Prototype board for [RC2014](http://rc2014.co.uk/).  There are three versions of the board:
## Rev 0
ProtoRC (Prototype for RC2014) is a 100mm x 100mm perf board with an Altera EPM7128 CPLD prewired to a RC2014 bus. The 5V programmable logic is flexible and has sufficient logic to handle a varieties of designs. Beside the CPLD, there is socket for an optional oscillator, an UEXT connector, LED indicator, RESET button, and RESET supervisor.  While some of the support components are surface-mount devices, the prototype area is designed for through-hole devices.

## Rev 1
Reduce the board height to 76mm so it is more stable.  Add dedicated 7-segment display circuitry.  Add CF interface and connected pads for DIP packages.
